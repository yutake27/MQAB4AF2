v1.0 - original version (8/04/2014)
v1.1 - added rep/nonrep data (1/15/2015)
v1.2 - added f-group identifiers to fasta file, domain description file. ECODf identifiers now used when availlable for F-group name. 
	Domain assemblies now represented by assembly uid in domain assembly status.
v1.4 - added seqid_range and headers	
v1.5 - swapped F-group ECODf accession with ECODf name (6/28/2017)

Description of the by-version distributable files released with each version of ECOD.

Files:
	1) ECOD domain desscription file
	2) ECOD FASTA database
	3) ECOD PDB tarball

-----------------------

1)ECOD domain description file

Thils file contains a single entry for each domain in ECOD

Column 1: ECOD uid - internal domain unique identifier
Column 2: ECOD domain id - domain identifier
Column 3: ECOD representative status - manual (curated) or automated nonrep
Column 4: ECOD hierachy identifier - [X-group].[H-group].[T-group].[F-group]
Column 5: PDB identifier
Column 6: Chain identifier (note: case-sensitive)
Column 7: PDB residue number range
Column 8: seq_id number range (based on internal PDB indices)
Column 9: Architecture name
Column 10: X-group name
Column 11: H-group name
Column 12: T-group name
Column 13: F-group name (F_UNCLASSIFIED denotes that domain has not been assigned to an F-group)
Column 14: Domain assembly status (if domain is member of assembly, partners' ecod domain ids listed)
Column 15: Comma-separated value list of non-polymer entities within 4 A of at least one residue of domain

2)ECOD fasta databse

Definition line is pipe-separated ECOD uid|ECOD domain id|EOCD hierearchy string|ECOD pdb_range

3)ECOD pdb tarball

Contains domain pdbs for manual representatives in ECOD, pdb files are indexed by UID
